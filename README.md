# Kohonen-Self-Organizing-Feature-Maps (KSOFM)
Self-organizing neural networks are used to cluster input patterns into groups of similar patterns.  They're called "maps" because they assume a topological structure among their cluster units; effectively mapping weights to input data.  The Kohonen network is probably the best example, because it's simple, yet introduces the concepts of self-organization and unsupervised learning easily.
